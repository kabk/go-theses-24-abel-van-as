            This thesis focuses on the financial side of the Dutch museum
            landscape. According to ICOM, the international museum council, a museum
            must function in a certain way to call itself a ‘museum’. Over the last
            few years, a lot of privately owned museums opened worldwide, but also
            in The Netherlands. How museums get funded is something that will be
            discussed in this thesis. In this thesis I also compare the current
            political and financial atmosphere of the museum sector of The
            Netherlands with the healthcare sector in the beginning of the
            21<sup>st</sup> century. A time of reorganisation of the health
            insurance system.

                Introduction
        </h3>
        <div class="text-container">
            <p class="body-text">
            During my third year of studying Graphic Design at the Royal Academy
            of Art (KABK) I started working at museum Voorlinden in Wassenaar. At
            this museum you can see a fine selection of mostly modern and
            contemporary art. Located out of town, museum Voorlinden is
            approximately a 25-minute cycle ride from Den Haag centre. For the past
            few years, I have frequently visited the museum enjoying the fascinating
            art works that have been exhibited there. You enter the estate through
            gates, in the distance you can see an old manor house, surrounded by
            gardens, ponds and cows grazing in fields. Walking towards the manor,
            you come across another building, with an impressive modern structure
            with walls made of glass and sandstone and a white roof. Together, the
            museum and the natural surrounding landscape takes you to a special
            place, far away from everyday life. When entering the museum, you see a
            lot of white walls, flooded with day light creating a minimalistic place
            (“Case: …”).
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
            During the first months that I worked at the museum, I was fascinated
            how visitors interacted with the art on display. By observing people,
            you could tell if people knew something about the artwork or artists or
            if people came to enjoy art for fun. I really enjoyed my time in the
            galleries guiding people and sharing information about the artworks.
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
            Modern and contemporary art are a big passion of mine. I enjoy going
            to museums, to explore the art world. I try to visit at least one or two
            museums per week. This was also a reason why I purchased a
            <em>Museumkaart</em>. It is the yearly Dutch national card for museum
            visits (“Bestel”). During my time at Museum Voorlinden I also
            experienced that some museums, like museum Voorlinden or <em>Escher in
            het Paleis</em>, do not accept the Museumkaart as a discount entry on
            into museums (“Plan je …” <em>and</em> “Ticketprijzen”). But why do some
            museums accept it, and others do not? With this thesis I want to focus
            on the financial side of museums. How does museum funding work? What is
            the financial structure of the Dutch government towards public and
            private museums in society? Are either public or private funded museums
            better?

            <p class="body-text">
            In 2022, there were 631 museums in The Netherlands. We can divide the
            museums into five topics: historical, art, business-science-technology,
            natural history, and cultural anthropology. 64% of the museums call
            themselves an ‘historical museum’ and 19% an ‘art museum’ (“Hoeveel …”).
            469 museums in The Netherlands are associated to the
            <em>Museumvereniging</em>. This is the Dutch national museum
            association, that also provides the earlier mentioned Museumkaart
            (“Museumcijfers”). The cost for an adult Museumkaart is € 75 per year
            (“Museumkaart …”)
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
            According to the Museumvereniging, in 2022 there was a total of 23.5
            million museum visitors, 5.6 million which were international visitors.
            1.3 million Dutch citizens have a Museumkaart, which amounts to 7.1
            million museum visits in 2022. It is important to know that these
            figures are only of museums associated to the Museumvereniging
            (“Museumcijfers”). According to the <em>CBS</em>, there were 17.6
            million citizens living in The Netherlands in 2022 (“Bevolkingsteller”).
            This means that roughly 7% of the Dutch people are frequently visiting
            museums, looking only at Museumkaart holders.</p>

            , created in 1946, is an
            international non-governmental organization that is associated to most
            of the museums worldwide. In 2022, the Extraordinary General Assembly of
            ICOM approved the proposal for a new museum definition: <em>“A museum is
            a not-for-profit, permanent institution in the service of society that
            researches, collects, conserves, interprets and exhibits tangible and
            intangible heritage. Open to the public, accessible and inclusive,
            museums foster diversity and sustainability. They operate and
            communicate ethically, professionally and with the participation of
            communities, offering varied experiences for education, enjoyment,
            reflection and knowledge sharing.”</em> <em>(Museum Definition).</em>
            This made me wonder, how do museums in The Netherlands position
            themselves in this definition?

                for the period of 2025 to 2028. This money is used for subsidy requests in the arts and culture sector<em>.</em> The ministry provides € 3.4 million for twelve regional museums, one for each province (“Hoe Ziet …”). This does not mean that there is no subsidy for other museums. Another way of national governmental subsidy is the

                . The foundation calls themselves a
                <em>‘financer and booster of the visual arts and heritage sector of The
                Netherlands and the Caribbean part of the kingdom’</em> (“Over Het

                provided € 60 thousand yearly to 27 museums (Groenewoud, Afran).
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
                On other governmental levels it is also possible to request
                subsidies. The province of Noord-Brabant is for example providing a
                total of € 30.5 million for cultural institutes within the province for
                four years (“Hedendaagse …”). In the city of Den Haag (province of
                Zuid-Holland), a museum can request a yearly subsidy between € 50
                thousand and € 1.1 million for four years (“Subsidie …”).
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
                According to the Museumverening, government departments funded 73% of
                the total shares for museums (that are affiliated to the
                Museumvereniging) in 2022. Half of the museums have the municipality as
                their most important shareholder. A quarter of the museums have their
                own revenues and private funding as their most important source of
                finance (“Museumcijfers”).
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
                Besides museums funded by the government, there are also museums that
                are privately funded. One example is the aforementioned museum
                Voorlinden. As part of my research, I conducted an interview with
                Suzanne Swarts, director of the museum. Swarts explained that every
                citizen contributes to subsidising public museums, through the taxes we
                pay. This also includes people who might not be willing to visit museums
                (Appendix).

                (Manning)<em>.</em> The thought behind is that this notion is very
                beneficial for a capitalist society, in order to work well (“Lilian
                …”).

                From the beginning, healthcare and art and cultural institutions have
                been a part of the so-called <em>quaternary sector of the economy</em>.
                This means that these institutions are not focused on making profit. The
                sector is also called the non-commercial services sector (“Economische
                …”).

                This made me question at what point is this explanation for the arts
                and culture and healthcare sector still valid? In the early 2000’s the
                Dutch healthcare system got privatised. The idea behind privatisation of
                the healthcare sector was that the market mechanism would be financially
                beneficial for both hospitals and patients. This would be created
                through the competition between semi-public health insurance companies
                (Kuijper).

                In 1976, in the middle of the new working-class neighbourhoods of
                Amsterdam, <em>Slotervaart</em>, Queen Juliana opened the (socialist)

                . The hospital was
                dismissed as the rubbish pit of the Amsterdam based hospitals. For the
                city, the Slotervaartziekenhuis was extremely important, serving mostly
                elderly people, people with drug addictions, sex workers and people with
                HIV. The hospital was because of its ideology a welcoming environment,
                it had a very informal atmosphere. Doctors were approachable (“MC
                Slotervaart: ...”). For a long time, the hospital was in financial
                distress. Therefore in 1997 the hospital was privatised and continued as
                a foundation. Unfortunately, after privatisation the hospital
                experienced even more financial difficulties.
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
                In the 1990’s, <em>Aysel Erbudak</em> (Damal, Türkiye, 1966) got in
                touch with <em>Jan Schram</em> in Amsterdam. Schram, a mystery
                businessman enjoyed looking at financial figures. Around the summer of
                2006, Schram was in the Slotervaartziekenhuis as a pulmonary emphysema
                patient (“Ex-eigenaar …”). Knowing that the hospital was in financial
                problems, Schram requested the annual reports of the hospital. On the
                11<sup>th</sup> of August, 2006, an advertisement in the newspaper
                stated that the <em>Slotvervaartziekenhuis</em> was for sale (Rosenberg
                and Tamminga). Together, on the 31<sup>st</sup> of August 2006, Erbudak
                and Schram bought the Slotervaartziekenhuis. Erbudak, directly entering
                the position as chairman of the board, was in the spotlight. Schram,
                shareholder of the company, decided to keep his distance.
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
                The hospital was released into a world ruled by the capitalist
                market, patients became customers. Both Erbudak and Schram had no
                experience in the health sector and ran the hospital from a business
                perspective. It is interesting to look at this particular situation,
                because the hospital became the first fully commercially driven general
                hospital in The Netherlands. Nothing like this has happened before in
                Dutch history. Erbudak was a director that got things done, she knew how
                to make financial deals. As soon as she became director, she
                renegotiated contracts with factories and looked at the level of
                staffing. After the sale, the hospital made a profit, much sooner than
                expected (<em>De Zorgkoningin</em>).
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
                It is difficult to say if the general situation of the hospital was
                better now it was a private commercial company, focusing on money. A
                couple of years later, Schram, the shareholder behind the hospital
                passed away in his own hospital. Erbudak, his business partner, who may
                have been his romantic partner as well, was now in a conflict with one
                of the biggest Dutch health insurance companies, <em>Achmea,</em> as she
                denies signing a contract with them. A lot of hospital patients were no
                longer insured anymore. This was the beginning of the end for the
                hospital. After the moment that Schram passed away, Erbudak got fired by
                the board of directors. The hospital was sold to an unknown buyer and
                continued as <em>MC Slotervaart</em> (Weeda and Wester)<em>.</em> This
                first fully privatised commercial general hospital of The Netherlands
                went bankrupt in 2018, together with another hospital called the <em>MC
                IJsselmeerziekenhuizen B.V.</em>, both being part of the <em>MC
                Groep</em> (“MC Groep”). This caused a big crisis in the Dutch health
                care system. Patients had to be transferred (in the worst conditions) to
                other hospitals in the region, medical appointments of people got
                cancelled. And what was the reason behind the bankrupt MC Slotervaart?
                Due to financial reasons the hospital was not saved by the almighty
                insurance companies Achema and <em>Zilveren Kruis</em> (<em>De
                Zorgkoningin</em>). The Rijksoverheid didn’t do anything about this
                situation (Soetenhorst).
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
                The Dutch healthcare system is semi-privatised, and one could argue
                that the insurance companies now play the role of the government. This
                small piece of history is exemplary for how the capitalist market
                functions in the healthcare sector. It does not matter what happens with
                the public. It feels as if there is money going around, it works for
                capitalism, whether this system serves patients remains highly
                questionable.

                In the midst of the financially good, commercial times of the
                Slotervaartziekenhuis, many Dutch museums, even rijksmusea, were in
                financial distress. Bankruptcy threatened (Donker). Knowing that the
                government reduced its subsidies for both the healthcare and arts
                sector, would it be good to compare these sectors to each other? What
                does the shift of the economic market mean now the healthcare sector is
                increasingly privatised? Is this a warning for what is about to happen
                with the arts and culture sector? Is museum privatisation perhaps the
                solution?

            </h4>
            <p class="body-text">
                Besides receiving subsidies from a form of government, it is also
                possible to find other ways to get the financial support. If you have a
                look at multiple museum websites, you can’t miss the big blown-up logos
                of the sponsors of the museums. Interesting to see how capitalist
                companies are financing the arts and culture sector of The Netherlands.
                How ethical is this way of financing, looking at the three largest
                financial banks of The Netherlands: <em>ING</em>, <em>Rabobank</em> and
                <em>ABN Amro</em> (“Triodos …”).
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
                What is the influence of these companies on museums? What is the
                reason that big financial institutions are injecting money into museums?
                Other organisations that are common in museum fundings, are:
                <em>VriendenLoterij</em> and <em>Het Cultuurfonds</em>.
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
                It is difficult to investigate in detail how much money financial
                institutes as banks donate to cultural institutes on a yearly basis. For
                arts and culture foundations, (e.g. Het Cultuurfonds and Mondriaan
                Fonds) it is easier to look into the financial figures. This raises a
                number of questions for me. Why it is harder to investigate the
                financial figures of for example ABN Amro bank, Rabobank and ING bank?
                Is the partnership really because of the importance of the arts and
                culture sector, or is it more important for the banks themselves? Why so
                mysterious?
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
                Since the 1950’s companies started collecting art. The main reason
                for this was to decorate the walls. In modern times companies claim
                different reasons. Sanne ten Brink, head curator of the ING bank claims
                that <em>‘Art encourages the employees to self-reflect.’</em> Danila
                Cahen, conservator of the ABN Amro bank collection says <em>‘Art brings
                the world into the company.’</em> Not every company is as reticent as
                these companies to talk about art collections. The health insurance
                provider Achmea even says <em>‘As an insurance company, in these times
                of austerity, we do not consider it responsible to have an extensive art
                collection. We don’t think we can justify that to our insurance premium
                paying customers’.</em>
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
                The ING bank states that the financial support of companies to the
                arts and culture sector is very important, especially since the
                governmental art subsidies have been reduced (Sterk and Elferink).

                The Dutch newspaper <em>NRC</em> published a list of the biggest
                private donators to the arts and culture sector in 2022. The 50 biggest
                donators donated € 282 million in total. That is 25% of what the

                money, materials, or labour to an individual or organisation to improve
                their conditions (“Wat Betekent …”). The privatisation of the Dutch

                In the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic, Lucy Bernholz wrote an

                Uncomfortable Truths’. In this article, Bernholz writes about the
                influence of governmental and non-governmental organisations on the
                concept of philanthropy. She explains that philanthropy is a product of
                the tax and governance structures. Besides, non-profit organisations are
                often linked to undercapitalised companies, companies that have the most
                need for governmental subsidies. According to Bernholz, in the USA
                <em>‘we underinvest in our shared public systems while we celebrate
                individual generosity. … By design, the nonprofit world is supposed to
                provide either an alternative to or a bolster for public programs and
                investments.’</em> Bernholz states that non-profit and philanthropic
                organisations are now operating in, and influenced by, the systems of
                society. <em>‘Nonprofit and philanthropic organizations that want to
                address our syndemic crises need to be prepared to take on the societal
                systems that created them ...’</em> (Bernholz).

                In the previous subchapter ‘Private funding’ I wrote about the
                sponsors of museums. If you look at the website of <em>Museum</em>
                <em>Boijmans van Beuningen,</em> for private funding the museum focuses
                on <em>‘American Friends’</em>, because of its tax-efficiency due to the
                <em>King Baudouin Foundation United States</em> (“American …”). The King
                Baudouin Foundation has its roots in Belgium. According to the website
                the foundation is ‘serving the public interest and increasing social
                cohesion’ (“Mission, …”). But what does ‘tax-efficiency’ actually
                mean?
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
                <em>ANBI</em> is the Dutch abbreviation for 'public benefit
                institution'. For individuals and organisations, it is fiscally
                favourable to donate money to an ANBI. Donating individuals may deduct
                the amount of donation from the income tax. For a donation to a Cultural
                ANBI, the donating party may even deduct that amount times 1.25.
                Donating organisations that pay corporate tax may deduct the amount of
                donation times 1.5 from the corporate tax return. (“Krijg ik …”). This
                tax benefit structure may also be a way for donors to avoid paying tax
                (“Vermogenden …”). This raises the question, does the donating party
                give money to help the museum, or is it because by donating they reduce
                their tax bills?
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
                In The Netherlands there are approximately 700 private foundations
                that are helping finance arts and culture projects. A lot of the
                organisations don’t have an ANBI status, which makes it difficult to see
                how much money they donate. The non ANBI organisations don’t have to
                publish financial annual reports, but also don’t receive tax benefits.
                Look for example at the earlier mentioned banks. Besides foundations
                there are also individuals and organisations that are donating money
                directly to the cultural institutions (Ribbens<em>).</em>

                that (public) museums are for 50% dependent on government subsidies.
                This is also why Vera Carasso, director of the Museumvereniging,

                also says: <em>‘PVV wants for you: Ending arts and culture

                Private museums
        </h3>
        <div class="text-container">
            <p class="body-text">
                According to Eva Rovers (cultural historian), the retreating
                government is one of the reasons why private museums are opening up:
                <em>“Before World War II, art subsidies were few and far between.
                Wealthy collectors set up museums for modern art out of a kind of
                exaltation spirit. You saw this at Museum Boijmans van Beuningen and the
                Kröller-Müller Museum. Private patronage is making a comeback because of
                the retreating government. In that sense, we are back to the last
                century.”</em> (Eikelenboom and Keunen). Suzanne Swarts describing one
                of the differences between public and private funded museums: <em>“If we
                (museum Voorlinden) believe in something, we do it. We decide what to
                do, but also what not to do. In government-subsidised museums, there are
                many conditions for exhibitions. … You will receive money, but you have
                to justify the decisions you make. One example is that many museums are
                making their collections digital. This is</em> <em>a government wish,
                conceived during the corona pandemic.”</em> (Appendix)

                public spaces, <em>‘What will we do with all these objects tomorrow? The
                future of museums requires us to think about the status of acquisitions.
                This is indeed why some people are pleased to see increasing numbers of
                private foundations-even with state support. Indeed, future-proofing
                should be part of any new definition of museums. And what I have said is
                true for all museums. It is vital to develop the notion of the “future,”
                far more so than “innovation.” … We must think of all futures together,
                ask questions that Google cannot answer, to seek out the future that we
                want to build collectively, not now as an end in itself, but as a future
                in the service of the present.’</em> (Dercon)

                Conclusion
        </h3>
        <div class="text-container">
            <p class="body-text">
                ‘In The Netherlands, are public-funded museums still feasible at a
                time that emphasises the importance of market forces?’ I think it is
                good to look at this question from different perspectives. From a
                financial perspective I would say, no, in Dutch capitalist society, with
                the government withdrawing funding, it is important for institutions to
                be individually financially strong. I think institutions should look
                after themselves. In The Netherlands, only a hand full of people visit
                museums. Why don’t the people that want to visit museums pay for the
                museums? 
                <button class="button1" onclick="toggleText('demo13', 'Something that is given or received in return for something else')">
                    <em>Quid pro quo</em>
                </button>
                <span id="demo13" class="demo"></span>
                 (“quid …”).
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
                From societal perspective, the answer might be different. One could
                argue that the ongoing public funding ensures the existence of museums
                in society. The market mechanism should not decide the existence of
                museums, because museums are fundamental in society. Museums can help us
                think about civilisation, about human existence. Museums can be
                containers of knowledge, culture. Places of exchange. Museums can
                connect people, can educate us, for instance through art. We must
                protect the qualities of society and political opinions. Museums are a
                safe space for people.
            </p>

                Arts and culture and healthcare started as non-profit sectors, but
                especially since the healthcare has been privatised in The Netherlands
                from the early 2000’s, it is interesting to compare them. Knowing this
                and looking into my research of museum funding in The Netherlands, I now
                have a further question: How can we ensure that museums continue to
                exist as a part of society in the future?

                Appendix: interview with Suzanne Swarts
        </h3>
        <div class="text-container">
            <p class="body-text">
                This is the elaboration of the interview that took place <br>on 12
                February 2024.
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
                Suzanne Swarts is the director of museum Voorlinden.
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
                <em>Joop van Caldenborgh</em> (Den Haag, 1940) comes from an ordinary
                family. By the age of 16, with the salary of his newspaper round, he
                bought his first piece of art. In 1970 van Caldenborgh established
                <em>Caldic</em>, a chemical trading company in the Rotterdam harbour.
                Over the years Van Caldenborgh collected art works, which he loved to
                share with friends, family members and colleagues.
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
                Around 2005, Suzanne Swarts (Ede, 1979) got in contact with Van
                Caldenborgh about an internship at the art collection. How Suzanne
                described it: <em>‘… een kijkje in de keuken nemen van de
                kunstcollectie’</em>, having an inside look at the art collection.
                Around that time the art collection already contained art works by for
                example <em>Damien Hirst</em> and <em>Schoonhoven</em>. Suzanne told me
                that in the years since, she mainly worked on projects such as art at
                businesses set up, in for example Vancouver and a hospital in Ghana.
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
                In 2011 van Caldenborgh and Swarts curated the exhibition called
                <em>‘I Promise to love you’</em> in the Rotterdam based Kunsthal. The
                exhibition even broke the record of Kunsthal visitors of that time. This
                was the moment when Van Caldenborgh and Swarts started talking of a
                museum of their own. There were conversations with the municipalities of
                Rotterdam and Den Haag for a spot in the city centres, but these
                locations were both not suitable.
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
                The Voorlinden estate, including an English style 1920’s mansion,
                formerly being a KPN office, was for sale. This became the location of
                the museum. Swarts described it as the perfect location to
                <em>‘subconsiously tickle the visitors’ senses’</em>. The museum opened
                in 2016.
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
                The outer walls of the museum are for 70% made of glass, to reveal
                the beauty of nature and arts.
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
                Van Caldenborgh donated the museum to <em>Stichting museum
                Voorlinden</em> just after the founding of the museum. Next to this,
                there is also the support fund, ‘to serve the museum as a backbone’. The
                revenue of the museum is made by ticket sale, museum shop, restaurant,
                house rental and patrons.
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
                Talking about the financial side of museums, Swarts explained that
                every citizen contributes to subsidising public museums, through the
                taxes we pay. This also includes people who might not be willing to
                visit museums.
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
                Swarts tells me that in the last 10 years museums got very popular.
                <em>‘It became the new church. Where people used to go to churches for a
                spiritual experience, people go to museums now.’</em> If you look at
                visitors who visit the museum for a particular artist, and they are
                traveling the world for this, ’<em>you can call it a pilgrimage</em>.
                <em>Art is a liquidation of life.’</em>
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
                During the interview I asked Swarts what she thinks the big
                differences are between government funded and private funded museums,
                knowing that museum Voorlinden is a private museum. Swarts described it
                as: <em>“If we (museum Voorlinden) believe in something, we do it. We
                decide what to do, but also not to do. In government-subsidised museums,
                there are many conditions for exhibitions. … You will receive money, but
                you have to justify the decisions you make. One example is that many
                museums are making their collections digital. This is a government wish,
                conceived during the corona pandemic.”</em>
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
                Looking at last year’s elections of the Dutch House of
                Representatives I asked Swarts what the influence of the new cabinet
                could be.
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
            <em>
                ‘Many museums are dependent on the infusion of money (government
                subsidies) - their elixir of life, but what would happen if this
                financial subsidy simply stopped? What would happen to a museum’s
                self-sufficiency? How will museums survive? This is not bad perse, but
                leadership is important in these scenarios. There will be stronger and
                weaker museums.’</em> As from a visitor’s perspective things would
                change as well. For example, the Museumkaart might stop. <em>‘Visitors
                will have to make decisions in what museums they will visit.’</em>
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
                At the end of the interview Swarts tells me about her future
                perspective of museum Voorlinden: <em>‘… working more with the
                landscape, restaurant, music and theatre. It is then about stimulating
                the senses and taste.’</em>
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
                Concluding the interview with the quote by Wayne Thiebaud, Suzanne
                Swarts shares:<br /><em>‘In the shadow all the light happens.’</em>
